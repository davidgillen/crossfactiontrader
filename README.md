==================

Basic site to query the World of Warcraft Auction House API, and then provide details on possible items to trade between factions for fun and profit.

Playing about with the World of Warcraft Auction House API.
Goal was to easily see price differences between Alliance and Horde factions.
Was useful, but I'd already made my millions. Feel free to take it and play
with it further.
I offer no guarantees either express or implied that this is in any way
useful. And it some with no documentation, although I'd start by looking
at the crons folder, in particular the DBSetup script

It was build with CodeIgniter (see CI_license.txt) and HTML5 boilerplate.
